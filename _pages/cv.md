{% include base_path %}

Education
======
* Ph.D. Candidate, Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL [2019 - Present]
* M.S., Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL [2017 - 2019]
  * Thesis: Determine the Role of Neglected Heavy Ions N+ in the Earth’s Inner Magnetosphere
  * Advisor: Raluca Ilie
* B.S., Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, 2013 - 2017

Research Experience
======
* Graduate Research Assistant, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL [Aug. 2017 - Present]
  * Advisor: Raluca Ilie
  * Developed Seven Ion Polar Wind Outflow Model (7iPWOM), the first polar wind model to describe the outflow of nitrogen and molecular ions along the magnetic field lines in the polar cap area. This effort not only improved our modeling efforts and showed significant improvement as compared with observations, but demonstrated the key role nitrogen ions play in the overall ionospheric outflow.
  * Further developed the Hot Electron Ion Drift Integrator Model (HEIDI), to include an additional ions species, which makes HEIDI the first and only ring current model to track the evolution and dynamics of all relevant ring current ions species.
  * Devised and developed the Energetic Neutral Atom (ENA) visualization model to generate TWINS-like ENA images from the simulation data.
  * Led a proposal that granted computer allocation on the XSEDE Bridge Supercomputer, which provides the computing resources to several other group members.
