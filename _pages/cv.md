{% include base_path %}

Work
======
* NASA Jack Eddy Postdoctoral Researcher, University Corporation for Atmospheric Research,
Boulder, CO.
 * Investigate the particle contributions originated from Moon and Earth to Earth’s geospace system by combining numerical modeling efforts with the ARTEMIS-THEMIS (lunar mission) observational data.
 * Joint position as a visiting scholar at the Space Science Lab, University of California, Berkeley, to collaborate with the leading researchers in planetary science.

Education
======
* Ph.D., Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL [2019 - 2023]
  * Thesis: Transport and Energization of Heavy Ions in Earth’s High Latitude Ionosphere
  * Advisor: Raluca Ilie
* M.S., Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL [2017 - 2019]
  * Thesis: Determine the Role of Neglected Heavy Ions N+ in the Earth’s Inner Magnetosphere
  * Advisor: Raluca Ilie
* B.S., Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, 2013 - 2017

Research Experience
======
* Early Career Scientist Member, International Team #528: Heavy Element, International Space
Science Institution (ISSI), Bern, Switzerland.
 * Address the problem of the Earth’s atmospheric loss of heavy elements from the behavior of the ionospheremagnetosphere system in response to geomagnetic activities.
 * Collaborate with 10 experts from space science, planetary science, atmospheric science, as well as paleomagnetism from 10 institutions.
* Graduate Research Assistant, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL [Aug. 2017 - 2023]
  * Advisor: Raluca Ilie
  * Developed Seven Ion Polar Wind Outflow Model (7iPWOM), the first polar wind model to describe the outflow of nitrogen and molecular ions along the magnetic field lines in the polar cap area. This effort not only improved our modeling efforts and showed significant improvement as compared with observations, but demonstrated the key role nitrogen ions play in the overall ionospheric outflow.
  * Further developed the Hot Electron Ion Drift Integrator Model (HEIDI), to include an additional ions species, which makes HEIDI the first and only ring current model to track the evolution and dynamics of all relevant ring current ions species.
  * Devised and developed the Energetic Neutral Atom (ENA) visualization model to generate TWINS-like ENA images from the simulation data.
  * Led a proposal that granted computer allocation on the XSEDE Bridge Supercomputer, which provides the computing resources to several other group members.
