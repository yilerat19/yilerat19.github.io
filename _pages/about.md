About me
======

I am currently a NASA Jack Eddy Postdoc Fellow hosted by Dr. Andrew Poppe in Space Sciences Lab, University of California Berkeley. My primary research focus is understanding the variations of near-Earth environment in response to the space weather. I will join the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Massachusetts Lowell as a tenured-track Assistant Professor in Fall 2025. 

I obtained my Ph.D. degree from [the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering in University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://ece.illinois.edu/), advised by [Prof. Raluca Ilie](https://ece.illinois.edu/about/directory/faculty/rilie) of [Heliophysics Research and Applications (HeRA) group](https://www.ilie.ece.illinois.edu/). I was awarded [the Outstanding Student Presentation Award both in 2019](https://ece.illinois.edu/newsroom/news/7615) and [2020](https://ece.illinois.edu/newsroom/news/34037) from the American Geophysical Union (AGU). I was also awarded the NASA Jack Eddy Postdoc Fellowship (2023-2025) and [Future Investigators in NASA Earth and Space Science and Technology fellowship (FINESST, 2021-2023)](https://ece.illinois.edu/newsroom/news/40395) to explore the overall contribution and the energization mechanisms of heavy ions in the polar wind. Additionally, I was served as [the Student Representative of the NSF Geospace Environment Modeling Program](https://ece.illinois.edu/newsroom/news/17359) (2020 - 2022) and Student Representative of AGU Space Sciences and Aeronomy. 

Outside the scholarly activities, I enjoy watching movies and sports games, and jogging/hiking.
